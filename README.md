I made this small library to make noise volume textures for [CloudSkybox]
(https://github.com/keijiro/CloudSkybox). This is basically quick and dirty hack --
neither sophisticated nor optimized. I'm thinking of reimplementing them with C++
to get performance gain, but no firm plam for it at the moment.
